```

---

## üìè **Estimated Impact**

**Lines to Remove:** ~4,000-5,000 lines (estimated based on typical Shadcn/UI component sizes)

**Before:** 49 files  
**After:** 17 files (16 components + utils + use-mobile if needed)  
**Reduction:** **65% smaller**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **use-mobile.ts** - Need to check if any components internally use this hook
2. **All unused** components appear to be from Shadcn/UI boilerplate
3. **Zero risk** - None of these are imported anywhere
4. **Easy to restore** - Can copy back from git history if needed later

---

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. ‚úÖ Check if `use-mobile.ts` is used internally by kept components
2. ‚úÖ Delete all 32 unused component files
3. ‚úÖ Run build to verify
4. ‚úÖ Commit changes

**Audit Complete!** Ready to proceed with deletions.
