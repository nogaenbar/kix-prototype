## 🎨 What to Review

As you look at the demo, please verify:

1. **Visual Accuracy:**
   - Do the buttons match your Figma designs?
   - Are the colors correct? (#407a3f primary, #365528 hover, #f5faf5 text)
   - Are the sizes precise? (36px, 32px, 24px)

2. **States & Interactions:**
   - Hover over buttons - does the color change look right?
   - Try the disabled buttons - do they look properly disabled?
   - Check the focus ring when tabbing through buttons

3. **Icon Sizing:**
   - Are icons properly sized? (20px, 16px, 12px)
   - Do they align well with text?
   - Is the spacing between icon and text correct?

4. **Real-World Examples:**
   - Scroll down to "Real-World Examples" section
   - These show exactly how buttons will look in your app
   - Compare with current implementation

## 🔄 Returning to Dashboard

When you're done reviewing the demo and want to see your actual app again:

**Option 1: Quick Edit (Recommended)**
1. Open `src/App.tsx`
2. Find line 203
3. Change:
   ```tsx
   const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState<string>("button-demo");
   ```
   To:
   ```tsx
   const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState<string>("dashboard");
   ```
4. Save (Vite will hot-reload)

**Option 2: I'll Do It**
Just say "back to dashboard" and I'll revert it for you.

## 💡 Tips

- **Zoom In/Out:** Use browser zoom to see details
- **Inspect Elements:** Right-click buttons → Inspect to see exact dimensions
- **Test Keyboard:** Tab through buttons to see focus states
- **Mobile View:** Not a priority now, but you can test if curious
- **Dark Mode:** Not implemented (not in Figma specs)

## ✅ What's Already Hot-Reloaded

The new button component is **already active** in your app! Look at the Vite terminal output:

```
7:16:14 PM [vite] (client) hmr update /src/components/ui/button.tsx
```

This means any **new** usage of `<Button>` will automatically use the new styles. We just need to update the 9 instances that use the old `kix-button-*` classes.
